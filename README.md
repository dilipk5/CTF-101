# Win board

This is my win board. Here I'll be sharing:

âœ… Writeups for HTB boxes which I solved without using any writeups.

ðŸ“š What I learned from each box (tools, techniques, new tricks).

ðŸ’» My journey learning low-level languages (C/Assembly).

ðŸ’£ Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering notes.

ðŸ§  Tips & tricks I discover along the way.


**Why this repo?**  
To track my growth, share my learning openly, and build a strong hacking foundation.
